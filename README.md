# AE4350_assignment
Final project for Bio-inspired Intelligence and learning for Aerospace Applications

The purpose of this assignment is to use reinforcement learning (RL) in order to guide a simulated rocket to a desired
target. A simple environment was coded from scratch, consisting of a rocket that could move in space and then a
RL agent was trained to get the rocket from itâ€™s starting position to the goal position. Different methodologies were
tested but it was found that a Cross Entropy Method (CEM) worked best for this application. The steps followed to
apply this method will be explained in this section and the results will be presented in the next one.
